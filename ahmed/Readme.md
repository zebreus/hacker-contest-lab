1. SSH bruteforce
2. FTP bruteforce
3. Something about the website
4. FTP misconfiguration to get the shadow file

The main site has a comment about `<!-- friends are always welcome -->`. I tried accessing the website under different hostnames, `friends.connect.usd` gives a login page. Now I am currently brutforcing the login page with a dictionary of variations on the old password and a few plausible usernames.
